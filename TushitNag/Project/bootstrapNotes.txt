Use the `no-gutters` to remove the spacing (gutter) between columns. Bootstrap uses padding to create the spacing (A.K.A “gutter”) between columns. If you want columns with no horizontal spacing, Bootstrap 4 includes a no-gutters class that can be applied to the entire row 

a display is divided into 12 columns 

in angular we can create a component for our html page layout for every page in our website for example header and footer for every page 

 so if we make a change to logo we just need to change the component so that it automatically changes everywhere


=> name on the marker of google map is called label

we can do this in two ways one is sending in the form id=?/name=? the other way how we send rest id to rest details
=>when you send the data from one page to another send a unique one as query parameters like delivery id to retrieve delivery information and display the delivery information


  {path: 'rest-details/:id', component: RestaurantDetailsComponent}, in router page
  [routerLink]="['../rest-details', rest.id] html
  this.id = params['id']; in next page

=> to give some space from the above div we use margin top
